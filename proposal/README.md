### To download the dataset...

This project will use the UNSW-NB15 dataset to build a model to detect network anomalies and intrusions. 
The UNSW-NB15 data set was created using an IXIA PerfectStorm tool in the Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Centre 
for Cyber Security (ACCS) (Australian Center for Cyber Security (ACCS), 2014) to generate a hybrid of the realistic 
modern normal activities and the synthetic contemporary attack behaviors from network traffic.

It is a free and public datasource available for academics and research purposes. The training and testing csv files of the dataset, 
required for this capstone project, can be downloaded from here:
